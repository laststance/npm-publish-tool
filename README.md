## Features

ðŸš€ **Explicit bump version in CLI, and then auto commit and push as release commit**  
ðŸ“¦ **Autogenerate Github release page**  
ðŸ”§ **Publish NPM in GitHub Actions**

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.0.0 or higher

## 1. Installation

You don't need to install this globally. Use it directly with npx:

```bash
npx @laststance/npm-publish-tool@latest init
```

## Usage(after setup complete)

```bash
npm run push-release-commit
# or directly
pnpm push-release-commit
```

## 2. GitHub Repository Setup

To use the automated releases, you need to configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:

### Required Secrets

1. **`NPM_TOKEN`**: Your NPM automation token

   - Go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) â†’ Account â†’ Access Tokens
   - Create an "Automation" token
   - Add it as a repository secret

2. **`ACCESS_TOKEN`**: GitHub Personal Access Token
   - Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
   - Create a token with `repo` scope
   - Add it as a repository secret

## 3. Update .github/workflows/release.yml

Update the `.github/workflows/release.yml` file with your own build steps.

## What It Does

When you run the init command, the tool will:

1. **Detect Package Manager**: Automatically detects whether you're using npm, yarn, or pnpm
2. **Install release-it**: Installs the release-it package as a dev dependency
3. **Install npm-publish-tool**: Installs @laststance/npm-publish-tool as a dev dependency
4. **Copy Configuration**: Creates `.release-it.json` with optimized settings
5. **Initialize GitHub Actions**: Creates `.github/workflows/release.yml` for automated releases
6. **Update package.json**: Adds a `push-release-commit` script to your package.json

## Generated Files

### `.release-it.json`

Configuration file for release-it with settings for:

- Git tagging and pushing
- GitHub releases with auto-generated release notes
- NPM publishing with provenance

### `.github/workflows/release.yml`

GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Triggers on pushes to main branch
- Detects release commits by pattern
- Automatically publishes releases

### Updated `package.json`

Adds a new script and dev dependency:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "push-release-commit": "push-release-commit"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@laststance/npm-publish-tool": "^1.6.3"
  }
}
```

The `push-release-commit` command is now available globally within your project and:

- Reads version from package.json
- Creates a commit with format "release v{version}"
- Pushes changes to remote repository

## Workflow

After initialization, your release workflow becomes:

1. **Make your changes** and commit them normally
2. **Update version** in package.json (manually or using `npm version`)
3. **Create release commit**: `npm run push-release-commit`
4. **Push to main**: The GitHub Action will automatically create the release
